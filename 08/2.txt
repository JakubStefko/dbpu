1. Na moim systemie (ubuntu) do blokowania pliku służy flock
2. Przykładowy kod:
    shell1> flock /tmp -c cat
    shell2> flock -w .007 /tmp -c echo; /bin/echo $?
            Set exclusive lock to directory /tmp and the second
            command will fail.

    shell1> flock -s /tmp -c cat
    shell2> flock -s -w .007 /tmp -c echo; /bin/echo $?
            Set shared lock to directory /tmp and the second command
            will not fail.  Notice that attempting to get exclusive
            lock with second command would fail.

    shell> flock -x local-lock-file echo 'a b c'
            Grab the exclusive lock "local-lock-file" before running
            echo with 'a b c'.

    (
        flock -n 9 || exit 1
        # ... commands executed under lock ...
    ) 9>/var/lock/mylockfile
            The form is convenient inside shell scripts.  The mode
            used to open the file doesn't matter to flock; using > or
            >> allows the lockfile to be created if it does not
            already exist, however, write permission is required.
            Using < requires that the file already exists but only
            read permission is required.

    [ "${FLOCKER}" != "$0" ] && exec env FLOCKER="$0" flock -en "$0"
    "$0" "$@" || :
            This is useful boilerplate code for shell scripts.  Put it
            at the top of the shell script you want to lock and it'll
            automatically lock itself on the first run.  If the env
            var $FLOCKER is not set to the shell script that is being
            run, then execute flock and grab an exclusive non-blocking
            lock (using the script itself as the lock file) before re-
            execing itself with the right arguments.  It also sets the
            FLOCKER env var to the right value so it doesn't run
            again.

    shell> exec 4<>/var/lock/mylockfile
    shell> flock -n 4
            This form is convenient for locking a file without
            spawning a subprocess.  The shell opens the lock file for
            reading and writing as file descriptor 4, then flock is
            used to lock the descriptor.
3. Czy blokada jest mandatory czy advisory: advisory
4. Czy można zablokować część pliku czy cały: całość pliku jedynie
